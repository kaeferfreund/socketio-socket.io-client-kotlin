## Unreleased — 1.0.0

First release: a Socket.IO 4 client for Kotlin and Android, ported from the
official JavaScript client at `socketio/socket.io@aaf2af36`.

### Client

- `SocketManager` and `Socket` with the JavaScript semantics: multiplexed
  namespaces, reconnection with jittered backoff, `connect_error` and
  `disconnect` reasons, send and receive buffering, volatile emits, catch-all
  listeners for incoming and outgoing events.
- Acknowledgements as callbacks or suspending `emitWithAck`, with per-emit and
  default timeouts, ordered retries (`retries`, `ackTimeout`) and cancellation
  that withdraws the packet.
- Connection state recovery (`recovered`, replayed events) and
  `clearRecoveryState()`.
- Authentication as an object or a suspending `AuthProvider` that runs before
  every connection attempt.
- `SocketIO.io()` with the JavaScript manager cache (`forceNew`, `multiplex`).
- Engine.IO 4 over HTTP long-polling and WebSocket: upgrade, `tryAllTransports`,
  `rememberUpgrade`, heartbeat, cookies (`withCredentials`), `extraHeaders`,
  per-transport options, custom transports.
- `SocketIOValue`, an immutable JSON model with JavaScript number formatting, key
  order and coercion; conversion from Kotlin and Java values including
  `org.json` types.
- Optional limits for buffers, packet sizes, nesting depth, attachments,
  polling bodies and handshake values.
- Flows for connection state, socket events and manager events; plugins and a
  tracer hook.

### Modules

- `socketio-okhttp`: OkHttp 5 transport stack, discovered automatically; TLS
  policies with private trust anchors, public-key pins and client certificates.
- `socketio-android`: network monitoring and binding, background policy, Doze-safe
  elapsed-realtime clock, logcat logging, Perfetto sections, `TrafficStats`
  tagging, trim-memory handling, KeyChain client certificates, org.json adapters,
  saved configuration, main-thread callbacks.
- `socketio-serialization`: kotlinx.serialization helpers for emits, listeners and
  acknowledgements.
- `socketio-testing`: in-memory Engine.IO and Socket.IO servers for tests on
  virtual time.

### Compatibility

- Android `minSdk` 26, JVM 17; apps on Kotlin 2.2 or newer
  (`socketio-serialization`: 2.3.20).
- Socket.IO 4.x servers (Engine.IO protocol 4). Socket.IO 2.x servers are
  detected and rejected with a clear error.
- WebTransport is not supported.

### Findings from the socket.io-client-java issues and forks

- WebSocket writes are paced below OkHttp's 16 MiB outgoing queue, which OkHttp
  answers with a close and browsers and Node do not have (socket.io-client-java
  #773, #726: bursts of large emits ended in `transport close`). A single message
  above 16 MiB fails with a transport error that names the limit.
- Regression tests for primitive arrays inside `org.json` payloads (#743),
  JSON-looking acknowledgement strings (#567) and many connect/disconnect cycles
  (#289); end-to-end tests wait for events instead of fixed delays.
- `SECURITY.md` and Dependabot (#785); the JVM process-exit behaviour of OkHttp's
  dispatcher threads is documented (#324).
- The reconnection delay stays at `reconnectionDelayMax` after about 1,024 failed
  attempts in a row, where JavaScript's backoff degenerates to 0 ms (a deliberate
  deviation, documented in PARITY.md).
- See [the triage report](Documentation/UpstreamIssueTriage-2026-09-25.md).

### Android: VPN networks (#1)

- `bindToActiveNetwork` no longer binds a VPN default network. Lookups bound to
  a Tailscale VPN failed with `EAI_NODATA` without sending a query, so apps
  behind the VPN could not connect with the default settings. The system routes
  unbound traffic through the VPN anyway; network changes are still followed.
- A lookup that fails on the bound network is retried with the system resolver.

### Fixes from a full code review

- Listener callbacks on a `callbackDispatcher` (the Android default: main
  thread) no longer count as running on the protocol executor: an `emit` from a
  listener used to run the protocol inline on that thread, concurrently with the
  executor.
- A request the HTTP stack refuses to build (a non-ASCII header value, a
  malformed URL) fails with a transport error instead of an uncaught exception
  that crashed Android apps or left the engine without requests; the cookie jar
  ignores cookies that are not printable ASCII.
- Converting received values to `JsonElement` (`decodeAs`, `onSerializable`) or
  to `org.json` (`toJson`) is iterative: a deeply nested payload no longer
  overflows the stack.
- A `Set-Cookie` `Max-Age` beyond the date range no longer throws inside the
  protocol executor; like JavaScript's Invalid Date, such a cookie never expires.
- With `tryAllTransports`, a transport that fails after it opened (a
  handshake this client rejects) is closed before the next one is tried; it used
  to keep polling, creating a server session per request. Closing a WebSocket
  that is still connecting aborts it instead of queueing a close frame behind a
  handshake that may never complete.
- `TlsPolicy.withPins`/`withPinnedCertificates` add to the pins of a host
  pattern instead of replacing them, so a backup pin no longer drops the primary.
- A binary packet header no longer reserves memory for the attachment count
  it declares; with `maxAttachments` raised, a huge count ended in
  `OutOfMemoryError` instead of waiting for (or rejecting) the attachments.
- An `AuthProvider` whose own `withTimeout` expires now fails the attempt
  with an `AuthProviderException` `connect_error`; the timeout used to be taken
  for a cancellation, leaving the socket connecting forever.
- Decoded packets are handled in a microtask right after the transport event
  that carried them, like JavaScript's `nextTick`. They used to be queued behind
  transport events already waiting, so a CONNECT followed at once by a close
  connected a socket of a closed manager.
- `SocketManager.close()` no longer leaves callers hanging: acknowledgements
  that can no longer arrive fail with `SocketDisconnectedException`, buffered and
  queued emits are dropped, and calls made after `close()` fail instead of
  waiting. Callbacks queued while closing still reach a `callbackDispatcher`,
  the executor stops only after the connection sent its last packets (at most
  10 s), and `SocketIO.io()` never hands out a closed manager again.
  `open(callback)` on a paused manager reports an error.
- Errors thrown by listeners (`TODO()`, failed assertions) and a throwing
  `listenerErrorHandler` no longer escape into protocol code, where they could
  stall the retry queue or skip a reconnection. Reconnection settings read or set
  in the manager's `setup` block are no longer lost, a rejected emit (buffer
  limit) no longer appears as `connect_error` on every socket, and an auth
  provider still running for an attempt that ended is cancelled.
- Polling requests follow redirects only within the same origin, and the
  WebSocket handshake follows none: a redirect to another host used to receive
  the extra headers (API keys), cookies and the POST body with the auth payload.
- A query string in the manager URL replaces the `query` option, as
  `engine.io-client` does (`opts.query = parsedUri.query`); the two used to be
  merged with the option winning, under a comment that claimed JavaScript parity.
- `EngineIOFrameDecoder` fails a frame longer than an array can hold with a
  parser error instead of a `NegativeArraySizeException`.
- Android: `configureOkHttp` now applies on top of the network binding, as
  documented, so a custom DNS or socket factory is kept; without
  `bindToActiveNetwork` the base client's DNS stays. The background policy also
  applies to a manager created while the app is in the background,
  `DisconnectAfter(Duration.INFINITE)` no longer pauses at once, closing a manager
  right after creating it off the main thread no longer leaves a lifecycle
  observer behind, and a KeyChain failure during the TLS handshake is a
  `connect_error` instead of an exception on OkHttp's thread.
  `readSocketIOValue` rejects data after the JSON value.
- Numbers print like JavaScript also at powers of two (`2^89` is
  `6.189700196426902e+26`, not 17 digits); checked against Node for 280,140
  values. The JSON reader and `javaScriptNumber` accept only ASCII digits, as
  `JSON.parse` and `Number()` do; a `null` map key converts to `"null"`
  instead of throwing.

### Validation

- Every supported runtime test declaration of the pinned upstream
  `socket.io-client`, `engine.io-client`, `socket.io-parser` and
  `engine.io-parser` suites has an assertion contract whose Kotlin tests must pass
  in the same CI run; see [PARITY.md](PARITY.md) for the numbers and the reviewed
  exclusions.
- A parser differential against the pinned JavaScript parser, end-to-end suites
  against Node servers (HTTP, HTTPS, WS, WSS, mutual TLS), Lincheck concurrency
  tests, Robolectric and emulator tests.
