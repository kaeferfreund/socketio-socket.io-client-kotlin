# Compatibility

[Documentation index](../README.md) · [Project overview](../../README.md)

## Servers and protocol

The client implements **Socket.IO protocol 5** (`SocketIO.PROTOCOL`) over
**Engine.IO protocol 4** (`EIO=4`), the protocols of Socket.IO 3 and 4 servers.

| Socket.IO server | Support |
| --- | --- |
| 2.x and older | Not supported. The connection fails with `connect_error` "It seems you are trying to reach a Socket.IO server in v2.x with a v3.x client, but they are not compatible (…)", or with an invalid handshake |
| 3.x | Same wire protocol, but not tested or supported |
| 4.x | Supported; the reference is the JavaScript client 4.8.x |
| 4.6+ with `connectionStateRecovery` | Additionally, connection state recovery |

There is no protocol-version option. Socket.IO 3 and 4 share the wire protocol,
so the handshake cannot prove the server's major version; 3.x is a supported-version
boundary, not something the client detects.

Other Socket.IO 4 implementations (Python, Go, Java, …) work to the extent they
implement the protocol like the Node server. Only the default parser is
supported; servers using `socket.io-msgpack-parser` or another custom parser
cannot be reached. A plain WebSocket server cannot be reached either.

## Transports

| Transport | Support |
| --- | --- |
| HTTP long-polling | Yes (OkHttp) |
| WebSocket | Yes (OkHttp), including upgrade from polling and `permessage-deflate` |
| WebTransport | No |
| JSONP polling | No |
| Custom | Through `transportFactories`; the server must implement the same transport |

## JavaScript options

Every option of `ManagerOptions`, `SocketOptions` and the Engine.IO options that
makes sense outside a browser exists under the same name with the same default.
Durations are `Duration` instead of milliseconds.

| JavaScript option | Kotlin |
| --- | --- |
| `forceNew`, `multiplex`, `autoConnect` | Same name |
| `reconnection`, `reconnectionAttempts`, `reconnectionDelay`, `reconnectionDelayMax`, `randomizationFactor`, `timeout` | Same name; `reconnectionAttempts` unlimited is `Int.MAX_VALUE`, `timeout = null` disables it |
| `path`, `query`, `extraHeaders`, `addTrailingSlash` | Same name; maps of strings |
| `transports` | Same name, transport names; transport classes go to `transportFactories` |
| `upgrade`, `rememberUpgrade`, `tryAllTransports` | Same name |
| `forceBase64`, `timestampParam`, `timestampRequests` | Same name |
| `requestTimeout` | Same name (polling only) |
| `withCredentials` | Same name; per-connection cookie jar, as the Node client |
| `protocols` | Same name |
| `perMessageDeflate` | `perMessageDeflateThreshold`; OkHttp compresses by size only, the per-message `compress` flag cannot be forwarded |
| `transportOptions` | Same name, `TransportOverrides` (`query`, `extraHeaders`, `requestTimeout`, `timestampRequests`, `forceBase64`, `path`) |
| `parser` | Not available; `parserOptions` bounds the default parser |
| `auth` (object) | `SocketOptions.auth` |
| `auth` (function) | `SocketOptions.authProvider` |
| `retries`, `ackTimeout` | `SocketOptions.retries`, `SocketOptions.ackTimeout` |
| `hostname`, `secure`, `port`, `host` | Taken from the URL |
| `ca`, `cert`, `key`, `pfx`, `passphrase`, `rejectUnauthorized` | `TlsPolicy` (no "reject unauthorized = false") |
| `ciphers`, `agent`, `localAddress` | Configure the OkHttp client (`okHttp { }` or `android { okHttpClient = … }`) |
| `closeOnBeforeunload` | Not applicable; Android: `backgroundPolicy` |
| `autoUnref`, `useNativeTimers` | Not applicable (Node/browser timer details) |

Options without JavaScript counterpart: `dispatcher`, `callbackDispatcher`,
`listenerErrorHandler`, `timeSource`, `random`, `logger`, `packetObserver`,
`tracer`, `plugins`, `bufferLimits`, `maxPollingResponseBytes`, `handshakeLimits`,
`clients`, `SocketOptions.outgoingInterceptor`. See [Configuration](Configuration.md).

The API follows the JavaScript client (`emit`, `timeout`, `volatile`, `onAny`,
`onAnyOutgoing`, `emitWithAck`, `SocketIO.io` lookup); the complete comparison,
including deliberate differences, is in [PARITY.md](../../PARITY.md).

## Platforms

| Component | Requirement |
| --- | --- |
| Android | `minSdk` 26 (Android 8.0), compiled against API 37 |
| JVM | Java 17 or newer |
| Kotlin | Built with Kotlin 2.4; consumers need a Kotlin compiler that reads its metadata |
| Coroutines | `kotlinx-coroutines` 1.11 |
| HTTP stack | OkHttp 5 (5.5.0), an `api` dependency of `socketio-okhttp` |
| AndroidX | `lifecycle-process` and `tracing` (added by `socketio-android`) |

`socketio-client` has no Android or HTTP dependency and runs on any JVM 17+.
Provide an HTTP/WebSocket stack through `clients` if you do not use OkHttp.

## Values

Payloads use `SocketIOValue`, which follows JavaScript's JSON semantics with two
deliberate points:

**Numbers.** JavaScript has one number type (a double). Here, an integral value
that fits a `Long` is stored as `Long`, everything else as `Double`; `1`, `1L` and
`1.0` are the same value. Integers are therefore **exact** up to ±2⁶³, while the
JavaScript peer rounds beyond 2⁵³ (`9007199254740993` becomes
`9007199254740992` on a Node server). Send large identifiers as strings. `NaN` and
infinities encode as `null`, `-0.0` as `0`, as `JSON.stringify` does.

**Object key order** is the JavaScript order: integer-like keys (`"0"`, `"1"`, …)
first in ascending numeric order, then other keys in insertion order. So
`mapOf("b" to 1, "2" to 2, "1" to 3)` is sent as `{"1":3,"2":2,"b":1}`, exactly as
the JavaScript client would send the same object.

Other conversions: `Date` and `Instant` become ISO-8601 strings like a JavaScript
`Date`; enums become their name; `ByteArray` and `ByteBuffer` become binary
attachments. Other types are rejected; see [Events](Events.md) for the full table.
