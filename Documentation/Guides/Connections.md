# Authentication and connection lifecycle

[Documentation index](../README.md) · [Project overview](../../README.md)

Examples assume an existing `manager` (see [Getting started](GettingStarted.md)).
`tokens` stands for your application's credential store.

## Namespaces

One `SocketManager` multiplexes any number of namespaces over a single Engine.IO
connection:

```kotlin
val manager = SocketManager("https://example.com", options)

val chat = manager.socket("/chat") {
    on("message") { event -> println("Chat: ${event.args}") }
}
val notifications = manager.socket("/notifications") {
    on("notification") { event -> println("Notification: ${event.args}") }
}
```

- `manager.socket(nsp)` returns the same socket for the same namespace. Its
  `SocketOptions` apply only when the socket is first created; the setup block runs
  on every call.
- The path of the manager URL does **not** select a namespace: only scheme, host,
  port and query are used. The request path is the `path` option (`/socket.io` by
  default).
- The connection closes when the last active namespace disconnects.

### `SocketIO.io` lookup

For code ported from JavaScript, `SocketIO.io(url)` returns the socket for the
namespace in the URL path and shares one manager per server, like `io()` in
`socket.io-client`:

```kotlin
val chat = SocketIO.io("https://example.com/chat")
val admin = SocketIO.io("https://example.com/admin") // same connection
```

A new connection is opened instead when `forceNew = true`, when `multiplex = false`,
or when the cached manager already has that namespace. `SocketIO.closeAll()` closes
every cached manager. Explicit managers are the recommended style when an app needs
control over the connection's lifetime.

## Authentication

### Static payload

`auth` is sent in the namespace CONNECT packet (`socket.handshake.auth` on the
server). It must be a `Map` or a `SocketIOValue.Object`:

```kotlin
val socket = manager.socket("/", SocketOptions { auth = mapOf("token" to accessToken) })
```

### Dynamic provider

When credentials change over time, use an `AuthProvider`. It is a `suspend`
function evaluated before **every** CONNECT, including reconnects; `attempt` is the
manager's reconnection attempt, `0` for the first connection. It wins over `auth`.

```kotlin
val socket =
    manager.socket(
        "/",
        SocketOptions {
            authProvider = AuthProvider { attempt -> mapOf("token" to tokens.validAccessToken()) }
        },
    )
```

The provider may suspend (for example for a token refresh); only its own namespace
waits. If it throws, the CONNECT is not sent and `onConnectError` receives an
`AuthProviderException` whose `cause` is your exception. Call `socket.connect()` to
try again.

A typical token renewal refreshes when the server's middleware refuses the token,
then connects again:

```kotlin
class Realtime(private val manager: SocketManager, private val tokens: TokenStore, private val scope: CoroutineScope) {
    val socket: Socket =
        manager.socket(
            "/",
            SocketOptions { authProvider = AuthProvider { mapOf("token" to tokens.accessToken()) } },
        ) {
            onConnectError { error ->
                if (error is SocketConnectException && error.isServerRefusal && error.message == "token expired") {
                    val target = this // the socket being set up
                    scope.launch {
                        tokens.refresh()
                        target.connect()
                    }
                }
            }
        }
}
```

### HTTP headers and query parameters

If your server authenticates the HTTP handshake instead, set headers on the manager.
They are fixed for the manager's lifetime:

```kotlin
val options = SocketManagerOptions { extraHeaders = mapOf("Authorization" to "Bearer $accessToken") }
```

`query = mapOf(...)` adds URL query parameters to every request. Use it only when
the server expects them, and avoid long-lived credentials in URLs.

## Lifecycle events

```kotlin
val socket =
    manager.socket("/") {
        onConnect { println("Connected as $id, recovered: $recovered") }
        onConnectError { error ->
            if (error is SocketConnectException && error.isServerRefusal) {
                println("Refused by the server: ${error.message}, data: ${error.data}")
            } else {
                println("Connection failed: $error")
            }
        }
        onDisconnect { reason, details ->
            println("Disconnected: ${reason.wireValue} (${details?.description})")
            if (!reason.reconnectsAutomatically) println("Call connect() to rejoin")
        }
    }
```

Each returns a `Subscription`. `SocketConnectException.data` carries `err.data`
from a server middleware. When `isServerRefusal` is `true`, the server rejected the
namespace and the socket does not retry by itself; other connection errors are
retried by the manager. `disconnect` is reported only after a successful connect.

| `DisconnectReason` | `wireValue` | Cause | Reconnects automatically |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `IO_SERVER_DISCONNECT` | `io server disconnect` | The server called `socket.disconnect()` | No |
| `IO_CLIENT_DISCONNECT` | `io client disconnect` | You called `socket.disconnect()` | No |
| `PING_TIMEOUT` | `ping timeout` | No heartbeat within `pingInterval + pingTimeout` | Yes |
| `TRANSPORT_CLOSE` | `transport close` | Connection closed (network change, server restart) | Yes |
| `TRANSPORT_ERROR` | `transport error` | Connection failed (for example an HTTP error) | Yes |
| `PARSE_ERROR` | `parse error` | The server sent an undecodable packet | Yes |
| `FORCED_CLOSE` | `forced close` | The manager closed the connection, for example `pause()` | No (`resume()` does) |

`DisconnectDetails` adds a `description`, the causing `error`, the WebSocket
`closeCode`/`closeReason` and, for polling, the HTTP `statusCode`.

## Reconnection

Automatic reconnection is enabled by default, with the JavaScript defaults:

| `SocketManagerOptions` | Default |
| --- | --- |
| `reconnection` | `true` |
| `reconnectionAttempts` | `Int.MAX_VALUE` (unlimited) |
| `reconnectionDelay` | 1 second |
| `reconnectionDelayMax` | 5 seconds |
| `randomizationFactor` | 0.5 |
| `timeout` (per connection attempt) | 20 seconds |

Each can also be changed at runtime on the manager, for example
`manager.reconnectionDelayMax = 30.seconds`.

Reconnection is a manager concern, so its events are manager events. Register them
in the constructor's setup block:

```kotlin
val manager =
    SocketManager(url, options) {
        on<ManagerEvent.ReconnectAttempt> { println("Reconnect attempt ${it.attempt}") }
        on<ManagerEvent.ReconnectError> { println("Attempt failed: ${it.error}") }
        on<ManagerEvent.Reconnect> { println("Reconnected after ${it.attempt} attempts") }
        on<ManagerEvent.ReconnectFailed> { println("Reconnect attempts exhausted") }
    }
```

A successful reconnection emits `Reconnect`, followed by `onConnect` on each socket
once its namespace has been joined again. `manager.events` offers the same events
as a `SharedFlow<ManagerEvent>`.

### Manual reconnect

`socket.disconnect()` leaves the namespace and does not reconnect automatically.
Call `socket.connect()` to rejoin; the same applies after a server-side disconnect
or a refusal. `manager.disconnect()` disconnects every socket in the same way (reason
`io client disconnect`).
`manager.close()` is final.

## Connection state recovery

Socket.IO 4.6+ can restore a session after a temporary disconnection: the socket
keeps its id and rooms, and the server replays the events it missed. The server must
enable it:

```javascript
const io = new Server(httpServer, {
  connectionStateRecovery: { maxDisconnectionDuration: 2 * 60 * 1000 },
});
```

The client needs no configuration. It remembers the session id (`pid`) sent by the
server and the offset of the last received event, and presents both on the next
CONNECT. Check the outcome with `socket.recovered`, `ConnectionState.Connected.recovered`
or `SocketEvent.Connected.recovered`:

```kotlin
socket.onConnect {
    if (socket.recovered) {
        println("Session recovered; missed events are being replayed")
    } else {
        reloadState() // fresh session: fetch what you need
    }
}
```

Recovery is not guaranteed: the server discards the session after
`maxDisconnectionDuration`, after a restart, and after a deliberate disconnect by
either side. Always handle a fresh session. The client does not deduplicate replayed
events, and [retries](Acknowledgements.md#retries) may resend client events; make
handlers idempotent where duplicates matter. To switch to another user, close the
manager and create a new one so no recovery state carries over.

## Pausing and network changes

`manager.pause()` closes the connection but keeps every active socket subscribed;
sockets see a `forced close` disconnect and nothing reconnects while paused.
`manager.resume()` reconnects them, with recovery when the server supports it.
`manager.isPaused` reports the state. The Android background policy uses these
methods; see [Android integration](Android.md).

On the JVM, or with your own connectivity monitoring, tell the manager about the
network:

| Method | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `setNetworkAvailable(false)` | A due reconnection attempt waits instead of failing and using up an attempt |
| `setNetworkAvailable(true)` | A pending attempt starts immediately instead of finishing its backoff delay |
| `reconnectNow()` | Starts a pending reconnection attempt now |
| `onNetworkLost()` | Closes the connection with `transport close` at once instead of waiting for a ping timeout |

With `android(context)`, `ConnectivityManager` drives all of these automatically.
